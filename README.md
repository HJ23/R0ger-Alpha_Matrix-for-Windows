# Project structure
#
## Project description :
  Main purpose of this project is creating efficient fully automatic chess bot using just C++ programming language 
  User has to indicate top-left and bottom-right corners of chessboard  thanks to advanced recognition algorithm (*Recognition Algorithm belongs to me idea is simple and supported by experimental results ) we could create same       software with zero human interaction but our main goal is efficiency !
